	<h1>An example of our work. Done by me in my last project at college</h1>

	<p>I had a project where I had to develop a game, and give it a story. It was rough at the begin, but then it worked out thanks to my teachers. As you can see in the photo, the layout and the photo were taken from this website, Boss Template. So here you go, a live example to convince you even more..</p>
